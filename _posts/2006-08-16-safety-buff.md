The duration of the flight is totally up to you Try some exercises, bounce about in the padded playrooms, or relax and have a drink in our two-story &#039;Padlaidum&#039; plush novelty bar This cozy TV bar provides a perfect atmosphere to enjoy being naked, and revel in the pleasure of sitting on a bear skinned chair or barstool and watching some good old American TV Not up for Season seven of Seinfeld We also have  playing on several premium movie channels For those who get high on miles, or are grotesquely deformed, we have special private beds for an additional fee, and unoccupied beds can be purchased in mid-flight When you fly Dari Air, you will receive only the best service from in-flight bar stewards and Dari-ators Worried about the fun leaking over into the real cockpit No need to be, since there is no access to the cockpit whatsoever The pilots board at a separate entrance, just for them, and are guarded by air marshals at all times So have a good flight Donâ€™t worry, you can pick up your clothes from our private baggage claim when we land&quot;
