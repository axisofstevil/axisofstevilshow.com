Attendance was poor at this past weekend’s BiAHs Convention 2005 Blame for the failure was placed on the following email that, according to sources close with the union, “says too much” The email was circulated to over 40,000 homebound people Sadly, due to the author’s name it was filtered as spam on almost every junk mail program
Thank you for your interest My name is F Merkin and I want to tell you about an exciting experience to dazzle the hardest shut-in; The BI-Annual Association of Hermits local #003 Chapter If you weren’t previously aware, The BiAHs seek to improve the overall standards and quality of shut-ins and introverts This event will feature several lectures and classes for your interest Enclosed is the day’s itinerary
