In a world of virtue, respect is given to the most sanctimonious times of a sock&#039;s life; the warm period of rest when the dryer has just finished Garments do not live in fear, in a land governed by free men When socks match, people have a higher potential to do amazing things In the land of matching socks there are white picket fences and strong gin; beings living happy and free from the bounds of constantly having to restock their consumer goods Never worried of reaching a drawer with one navy blue sock and one black sock, we brave men and women must defend all that humanity means to be, and crush the sock menace
