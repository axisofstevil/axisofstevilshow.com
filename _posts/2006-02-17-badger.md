Aggressive time pilfering is the behavior of choice for one of nature’s most loathed creatures, The Badger Not the wise character or warrior TV would lead you to believe, Badgers are often moronic and underhanded If you see a badger, drop whatever you are doing and get indoors The only sure way of remaining safe is to be out of a badger’s field of vision A badger could appear at any time, thus you should always be prepared; readiness will give you an edge in any badger altercation
A: Badgers will come at you fast If you hesitate in a response, you will be left vulnerable As his words speed towards you, pat the badger firmly on the tummy and say &quot;adda boy&quot; This unexpected gesture, will shock the creature into a docile state and provide you with time to escape the situation
* Fun fact: women are a mystery
