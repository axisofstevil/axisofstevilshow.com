Animals can only get so many jobs in the modern work force Being far too brute for the boardroom and too Madison Avenue for the farmhouse, the &quot;working Joe‚Äù animal is seen fit for only the fast food industry, , and product testing There is a vast conspiracy in this country to keep the animal kingdom relegated to the farm and forest America is being brainwashed to deny animals the right to work Animal cruelty groups would like you to think that animals are neglected and treated horribly in cages This is certainly not the case The lighter side of animal testing is that it is one of the few jobs where animals are treated as equals
