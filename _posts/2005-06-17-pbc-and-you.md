Spiedo, a future minded company, in attempt to bring the words into the common vernacular have released their own &quot;Banana Hammock”; a sleek, lightweight, versatile banana peel beach hammock Spiedo harvests the husks of genetic super bananas and treats them with the chemical preservatives RINEOFOB The product of this is a fuzzy perpetually cool pouch that you can hang anywhere on the beach The Quick Whip™ function makes unsheathing the hammock virtually effortless Now you can easily relax and enjoy the day in comfort Speidos aim in this daring naming is to make “Banana Hammock” a household name By turning &quot;Banana Hammock&quot; into the brand name associated with all hammocks, the slang word of middle class white kid for the school bus and the name of a Norwegian pop-ska band Spiedo hopes to induce a climate where the beach epidemic of the original banana hammock can be discussed in the open This problem must be addressed, but before this alteration can be made the public must be prepared
