The New Day Foundation- Often pigeonholed as “radical” or “new-agey”, the New Day Foundation believes the solution to most of the world’s problems can be solved by adding an additional day to every week This new day would give people 24 more hours to get heir work done, discuss their problem, research cures, or any other number of productive activities Committee Chair and figurehead of the organization, Sobert Daes, has made it clear that his organization would not settle for a simple reordering of the Julian calendar, but rather the actual addition of 1,248 hours in the time it takes the earth to travel around the sun Daes claims he has devised the world’s first planetary sail, a net of reflective fabric, 600 miles-long, that if unfurled 2 miles above the globe, tethered to a massive concrete slab or natural rock formation, such as the Rocky Mountains, could catch solar rays creating just enough drag to slow the planet by the correct amount of time Scientists, who have examined the foundations plans in great detail, believe it would work but call attention to the large shadow the sail would cast over the planet
