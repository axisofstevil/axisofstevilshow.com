Lead by Juan Conroy, the most ruthless chicken to ever walk the face of the earth, Kickin Chickin has made quite a name for themselves in the ultra top-secret world of espoultrynage He has been linked to 16 separate assassinations, and 24 felonious counts of silverware throwing The most recent activity was in response to the ruxpin crisis While Conroy would like to maintain a low profile, a recent drought of civil unrest has made him more desperate The Axis of Stevil, while not wishing to encourage this sort of behavior, is happy to display the latest Kickin Chickin advertisement for their new public campaign
And much more
These posters can be seen hanging on buildings and marquees all around the Kickin Chickinâ€™s home town of Kinstiona, Nebraska They may also be viewed in the yellow book
