It is in your best interest to be weary of the Walrus It is far too often that the obvious words of wisdom go unheeded by mankind Warnings more blatant then the universal “Don’t drink orange juice after brushing your teeth” The walrus is a poor sport Truly the most brash and inconsiderate of creatures, he is known for often forgetting birthdays and anniversaries You must never challenge him in anyway shape or form For if you best him he will explode into a fiery rage and assault you with deadly force Thrashing at you with whatever objects are near by
