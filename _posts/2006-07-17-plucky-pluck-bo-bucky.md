There are several hallowed traditions that grace the halls of Acme Looniversity  Every year, the students play the famed &quot;Name Game&quot; while performing a frantic dance This toon tradition takes place in some form of fashion in every grade level Plucky Duck has never understood the excitement because he never knew how to play the game Because of this, Plucky has never attended a &quot;Name Game&quot; dance party Every year, something would always come up that would keep him away It was almost as if it was his destiny to never go When he was three, and in kindergarten, his mother &#039;fell down the hole&#039; and he was forced to rescue her instead of attending the game When he was in fifth grade, the school bus drove off without him On the day he planned to ask out Shirley the Loon, he waited outside the library to meet her, only to find that she stood him up to attend the dance with Concord Condor
