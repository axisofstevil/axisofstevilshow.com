The Axis of Stevil is aware of the new public trend of eating large quantities of premium Jack and Mozzarella cheeses This is said to induce nightmarish and disturbing imagery in your dreams, a lucid trip if you will While there is no adverse health risk to this overdose besides your waistline, heart, and ability to operate small-incased vehicles The mental trauma that ramifies itself after the tripper has awoken is staggering
The Axis of Stevil wishes the best for all recovering cheese heads, and their families
