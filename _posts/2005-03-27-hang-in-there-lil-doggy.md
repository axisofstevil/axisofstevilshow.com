The Axis of Stevil understands the feeling of frustration you feel in life, such as the frustration of bills &amp; “re-sponsda-bility” In quick summation, Life is sometimes like this Market research studies have shown conclusively that most people associate their financial life in terms of monopoly money and small terriers As a terrier with a large wad of brightly covered money you walk the streets looking for things to buy &amp; places to stop and rest You live a life of decadence Wining and dining around town, not thinking about what’s happening; suddenly, it’s boardwalk and you’re screwed As a provider for the general public’s health, The Axis of Stevil suggest that you make this  your desktop background as a healthy reminder to keep yourself focused on your obligations
