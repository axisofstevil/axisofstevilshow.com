In early 1985, Ken Forsse on a wilderness expedition in the Yukon stumbled upon a secret valley nestled within a volcanic crater The sub terrain lava flows made the ecosystem of the valley a lush tropical rain forest Forsse discovered in this forest a race of advance bear pygmies who called themselves the Ruxpinanda Kind and peace loving, the Ruxpinanda took Forsse into their society and taught him their ways The Ruxpinanda, as Forsse later remarked,
While all this was happening, a toy bearing the Ruxpinanda&#039;s likeness sold like hot cakes during the &#039;88 holiday season While both US and Canadian governments deny these allegations The Axis of Stevil is aware of the Ruxpin&#039;s plight Refusing to allow this injustice to continue any longer The Axis of Stevil bankrolls a team of elite ninjas whose sole task is to protect and free all of the Ruxpins
