Gigalibre is a data-mining monster that has inhabited the World Wide Web since 1998 No one is sure from what realm the beast was summoned, but on occasion he has been seen sporting a SCUM “Member’s Only” windbreaker It is safe to say any monster affiliated with “Saboteurs and Criminals United in Mayhem” is one to be feared Every evening, Gigalibre wanders the net like a rogue janitor, emptying bins of unclaimed survey results Many unaware web producers think of this as a service to them They go as far as to create special Gigalibre &quot;pet&quot; doors into their sites to aid the monster’s clean up It is estimated that Gigalibre has more then 87 million results on file, making it the third largest pool of raw web surfer data owned by a monster, spook, or unearthly creature
