While some would pity this creature for its lot or laugh at the cruelty of fate, The Axis of Stevil advises you to do what the Masticophis can&#039;t do, and understand your probability rating At its birth, each creature gets a randomly generated Probability Rating This numerical value between 1 and 100 is a multiplier cog in lifeâ€™s path guider The higher your Probability Rating, the more likely you are to get the best possible outcome of a given situation The average human born between 1980 and 1984 has a PR of 596; just slightly luckier then average The Masticophis Flagellum in comparison has a PR of 2633
