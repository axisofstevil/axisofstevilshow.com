The mongers of the everyman cheese are starting a revolution  Wensleydale and the Project for the Betterment of Fancy Cheese have controlled the international cheese market from a quiet cow farm outside East Shore, Nebraska for many years  Due in large part to an ingenious set of media controls, indoctrinated stronger and stronger with every passing generation PBFC controls all of the worldâ€™s cheese supplies It has gotten to the point that any independent criticism of a Gouda, or oil-wrapped mozzarella, is quickly stripped of credibility by inexplicably loud rhetoric This tight net around thought has created a lineage of &quot;historically better&quot; cheeses The players of this society are determined by their age in the cheese culture
