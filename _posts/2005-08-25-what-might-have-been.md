Scientist, Julius Robert Oppenheimer, speculated in a 1951 report* that any chimp over the age of 3 could have their bloods infused with a viscous mix of aluminum soap and gasoline These chimps could then be released into enemy territory and take nest, awaiting instructions from a two-radio earpiece At the best strategic time the chimps would be instructed to flick on a lighter The tiny spark would be enough to ignite the chimp into a fiery napalm explosion A well-positioned infused alpha chimp could decimate an area the size of a football field
