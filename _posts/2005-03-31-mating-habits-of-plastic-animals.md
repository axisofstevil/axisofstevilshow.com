Axis of Stevil not only stands for the arts, but also for our environment The endangered species list is growing larger every day It is the priority of the Axis of Stevil Environmental Specialist Committee to take every step to help the lesser-known endangered species Recent studies show a dramatic change in the number of such species as, The Hi-Ho-cheerio tree, Ewoks, and most importantly the Sanspod Polymerkious
A prominent byproduct of the Polymerkious&#039; unique behavior of setting  is a key environmental necessity As the Polymerkious sets his traps, an endorphin called  is excreted When released, this endorphin has an extremely high NCFC* count When combined with atmospheric moisture NCFC create what is known commonly as the O-zone layer The NCFC&#039;s have many other positive effects on the environment It is a known plant accelerator, and smells faintly of cinnamon rolls The average Polymerkious has 15 to 20 grams of NCFCs in their body A byproduct of this is that upon death Plastic Rats will crystallize into Pyrite &quot;fools gold&quot;
