“I asked to see her identification, to which she replied ‘Why’” explains Officer Head  “I told her I needed to know who she was, and again she asked why  This continued until I demanded she cooperate”  The two eventually stepped outside to Officer Head’s cruiser “When I told her that I would have to get East Shore Animal Control to take Buttons, she became violent  She took my nightstick from my belt and swung it while screaming, ‘Go away, Beardy-Head’ and ‘I hate you, Lady’  It was clear that Mindy had suffered some serious post-traumatic stress after she went missing when her parents passed  I really feel bad for the girl, but at least she’s going to get help after she serves jail time”
