With this in mind, The Axis of Stevil teamed up with leaders of the entertainment community and has begun production on a series of public service announcements, movies and video games that show the harsh, gritty reality of crime and violence, that comes from your childhood streets, in a disenfranchised future by breaking the code of meaning found in many television classic These stirring classics will also provide a much-needed boost for the struggling entertainment industries, whose once-keen instincts were destroyed when a large part of the population embraced a retard named Napoleon Dynamite
“When you are young, the world seems like a wide-open plain Limitless frontiers, a future with dinosaurs and space adventures It&#039;s not until your grandpa Lou takes 6 bullets, outside of Sammy’s tackle shop that you realize the future is bleak and you just gotta do what you gotta do
