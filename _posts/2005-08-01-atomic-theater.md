To fix this sync problem, you must simply undertake an activity that appeals to your most basic instincts, seeing a movie Why you ask Simply put, the setup of the Movie Theater box office acts and reflects the behavior of the basic atom Patrons stand outside in confused blobs of smoking teens, an obtrusively large party of friends waiting for the last member to get back from Subway and five people just trying to buy a ticket The sunny interior of the atom is populated with people constantly in motion, coming and going from concessions, from the lobby, to the arcade, to the unknown blackness of the theaters, and finally returning to the hurried, chaotic order of the theater exteriors The Atomic Theatre Experience is much like life in an atom You wind up traveling through chaos to find order and then on to the black theater of the next universe The electrons return to their natural behavior when the show is over This time frame is generally 90 minutes
