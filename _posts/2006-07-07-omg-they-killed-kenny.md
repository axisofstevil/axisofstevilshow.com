On the surface, this coincidence and happenstance is a small side note to the general tragedy of death Sources close to the Lay family have come forward to The Axis of Stevil, on the condition of anominitity, and advised the wing of media oversight and skepticism to dig deeper into Ken Lay&#039;s sorted past The novice hunters would see Lay&#039;s comradery with George W Bush and stop there Surely the most corrupted president in recent history could do a solid for one of the most corrupted executives in recent history Yet, the waters of this conspiracy run even deeper Lay, a native of Missouri and born in the compromising position of being an impoverish ministerâ€™s son, had nothing to lose in his life Looking for money, he joined the Navy in 1968, where members of the RAND Corporation selected him at random to be a test subject in a massive project to instill Pentagon-controlled operators into the highest echelons of American culture
