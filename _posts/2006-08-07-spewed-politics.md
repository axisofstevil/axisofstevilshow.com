The shark bites incident taught Cranker a valuable lesson when releasing a product Since then, they have mandated heavy testing of all fruit snacks before releasing them to retailers Their current and most popular fruit snack, &#039;Spewers&#039; spent three years in clinical trials at three different animal labs &#039;Spewers&#039;, famous for contorting your face with its intense fruit flavor, was at first a danger to the consumer The ratio of power fruit serum to stable chewy shell was frequently miscalculated Many mice exploded into large durians after only a small sampling of the product The goal of a fruit indulgence that could temporally alter your perception to the peaceful splendor of a fruit seemed impossible However, thanks to the tireless efforts of many rodents, and a round the clock team of orange midgets manning a 18 foot tall fruit-juicer, the recipe for &#039;Spewers&#039; has since been refined to provide just the right combination of fructose-infused face-altering toxins and a day&#039;s worth of Vitamin C
