While the world credits Alfred Nobel for the invention of dynamite in 1886, Napoleon Dynamite has been in production since 1769 Started by the emperor of France, Napoleon Bonaparte, the dynamite was discovered in a state-run fireworks factory in the northern department of Pas de Calais The factory workers stumbled upon a potent explosive, while trying to create a sparkling rocket without the use of messy black powders The discovery was named in honor of Bonaparte, who was impressed by it’s destructive force Mass production of this new firecracker began immediately Demand quickly exploded as word of the emperor’s mighty new ‘boom stick’ spread across the nation The unique recipe for Napoleon Dynamite has become a closely guarded secret and is known only by the three master-blasters of the Calais factory Currently, Napoleon ships 1600 cases of dynamite per day, doing what its namesake never could; conquering the world”
