March kicks off one the greatest meat festivals of the year; far better than any bratwurst convention Dutch &amp; Belgium immigrants started the month-long “Tastes of Pork Festival” in 1912 It was originally designed to drive up the market price of pigs after the traditional post-Christmas decline in meat sales Pig farmers often refer to January and February as &#039;the mill&#039; or &#039;deadzone&#039; One out of every five pig farms fail during these months and most pig ranchers are hard-pressed to make enough money to cover their expenses New years resolutions, debt, and oversaturated meat pallets are often blamed for the consumption decline every new year

The festival kicks off today with the unveiling of a new sandwich named “The Mecklenburg”, after this year’s host city This colossal sandwich starts with both &quot;down east&quot; vinegar-based minced barbecue and South Carolinian &quot;Maurice’s&quot; mustard-based barbecue On top of that is a hearty layer of jack cheese, three slices of honey-baked ham, a butterfly pork sausage and juicy rosemary tenderloin Served, ironically, between two thick slices of Jewish rye bread, the sandwich weighs in at just less than 64 ounces
