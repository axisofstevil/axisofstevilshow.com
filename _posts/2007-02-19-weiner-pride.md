“It’s still a family restaurant” says Webber, “Nothing has been removed from the menu The only item changes are the added vegan-friendly items I understand the concern among regular customers, but I’m not discrediting the [restaurant] chain by any means  I enjoy A&amp;W and chose them based on their hearty cuisine, family values, and choice in initials  I’ve worked with homosexuals throughout my career and can honestly say that they are just as human as any heterosexual I’ve met  America is heading into a different direction, but it needs that first kick in the arse to get things going  I believe Gay &amp; W is just that”
