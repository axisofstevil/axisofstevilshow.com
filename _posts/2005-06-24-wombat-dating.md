The Axis of Stevil, conducting a 10-year long study on the wombat to better understand the nature of their problem, thought perhaps a cure could be found for their social short fallings What was discovered goes well beyond what was expected Through a twist of fate and trade winds, the sole birthing grounds of the wombat are right beside a 20 lb pile of 1974 ‘Ultra Batchelor&#039; magazines (the largest such stockpile still in existence) At the foot of this porn mountain wombats are brought into the world and educated from the 1st day on the ways of the Ultra Bachelor Burrowing into the pile for shelter many wombats spend their nights in their tunnel dwellings reading the strange writing on the wall Learning &quot; Five Great Lines For Any Situation, and &quot;What Not To Say When She Wakes Up”, these early events in the life of a wombat forever scar him and retard his social growth With the support of the Australian government, the Axis of Stevil facilitated in air lifting of the porn mound from the wombat ecosystem safely to the middle of the Indian Ocean Fate once again smiles on the wombat
