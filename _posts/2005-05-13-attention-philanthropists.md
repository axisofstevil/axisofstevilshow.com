The question is often asked, &quot;What is this website all about&quot; It is a complex answer for certain The Axis of Stevil is a company of modern free expression, thought and art The theories of the organization do not have to be explained except through one central existential idea that it is all relative and connected The ideas presented through its T-shirts, comics, flash animations, drawings, photos, publications and film will come back around to each individual reader in time The goal of The Axis of Stevil is to challenge preconceived notions of art, business and success The founders of The Axis of Stevil, Steven and Graham, believe that success is all but guaranteed when you think logically and act positively The Axis of Stevil serves as a vehicle for artists and creative people to express their ideas on a national forum through its merchandise and publications By breaking from the mainstream, The Axis of Stevil keeps itself in tune with the creative community and young demographic This will insure its place in the highest echelons of the new wave
