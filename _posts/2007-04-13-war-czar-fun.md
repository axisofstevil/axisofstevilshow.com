Only the most moneyed of minors can take part in Flintheart Glomgold’s Battleship In each Flintheart Glomgold’s Battleship box, you’ll find 1:8 scale replicas of an aircraft carrier, battleship, submarine, destroyer, and patrol boat, all manufactured at the finest United States military bases using tax money given by the meager middle-class The objective of the game is to maneuver your fleet of remote-controlled mini-F35s, each equipped with three 50-gallon tanks filled with gasoline, crude oil, and Sacagawea dollars, and crash them into your opposition’s battalion The first one to destroy their opponent’s armada is crowned ‘War Czar’ while their housemaids collect the coins from burning boats and bodies of water
