Are you tired of dealing with the hassles of our modern legal system Frustrated with making appearance after appearance in court You are in luck The ATM of Justice is being rolled out across the United States and will soon be in your area Taking a page from the cashless revolution, the Department of Homeland Security has rolled most traffic and minor law infractions into simple &quot;ATM-like&quot; procedures Approach the ATM and enter your case number, enter a plea of guilty or not guilty on the keypad After this simply swipe your credit or debit card and get a receipt to keep for your records This system frees up the legal system by admitting that all minor infractions are laws designed to collect revenue from the people No longer will you have to waste time and money on lawyers and traffic school Simply fork over money at your nearest ATM of Justice and receive a receipt for your due process
