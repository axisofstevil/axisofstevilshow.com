Designed by Harvey &#039;Two-Face’ Dent, former district attorney for Gotham City Corroboration is over-loaded with actual questions and responses Pulled from a library of thousands of examinations and integrations, Two-Face has created a clever stack of forty question cards, seventy-two Corroborating flash cards, four direction changing &quot;Plead the Fifth&quot; cards and four &quot;Flee the Scene&quot; wild cards Played similar to Uno, the game starts when the dealer lays down a question card Players lay response cards down, one at a time, further corroborating each other until one person has no good excuse, or response to the question and loses The loser receives all the cards in the pile, and the dealer starts the next round by laying down the next question card To win a player must be the first to play all the cards in his hand, and shout “Not Guilty” Should ambiguity arise during game play, a handy index contains a quick reference chart detailing which cards are valid answers to each of the forty questions
