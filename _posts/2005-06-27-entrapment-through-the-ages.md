If you or someone you know suffers from Observaphobia there is hope; new laws are being enacted to prevent reality entrapment The World Order Governing Body of Entertaining Reality Television (WOGBERT) has been established by a coalition of 84 countries It is hoped that WOGBERT can bring a set of standard rules and regulatory practices to the production of reality TV One of their 1st orders of business when they convene in late 2005 is to establish the primary rule of reality TV If the subject asks you of the presence of reality TV directly, you must let them know that they are being filmed
