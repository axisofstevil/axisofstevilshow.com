As a green and white prison bus lumbered up the lone service road leading to the cabin, Talway and a group of eight other wayward souls, were unaware that they might never see the foot of the mountain again It is said that an ancient beast once terrorized the flatlanders who traveled to the lodge and ate anyone who made it more then 2000 feet from the safety of the shelter A generation later, deep in the rotting bowels of the cabin, the Abominable Snowman restlessly waits for his next victims to arrive This winter, be sure to Ski No Evil
