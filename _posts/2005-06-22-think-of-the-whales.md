When you find yourself in a large pocket of bad luck known as a Simultaneous Hysterically Ironic Thunder Storm, The Axis of Stevil asks that you keep in mind the world around you and not transfer the SHITS on to anything else When bad luck ends with you, it flushes the SHITS from the environment making the world a happier more enjoyable place As a last bit of advice, remember, if you are GOING to F it up, SAVE A WHALE
