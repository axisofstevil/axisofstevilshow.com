Fueled by sandwiches and a profitable initial public offer, Google developed the googlites, an orbiting ring of high tech surveillance and market research machines By monitoring your every position Google can give you direction anywhere, recommend a close by restaurant, and make sure you see specially tailored electronic Google ad boards
All this surveillance leads many concerned people to the brink of paranoia fearing that Google is in complete control of their life These people suffer from what is known as Hananoba-phobia, or fear of being crushed by an invisible enemy Google&#039;s quick adoption into the culture from its relative obscurity has startled many, kindling a new generation of hananobaphobics
