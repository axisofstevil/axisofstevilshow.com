To celebrate the 4th Annual Beaville Downtown Festival, a statue of a silver beaver will be unveiled at Flanagan Park The section of Flanagan Park from 3rd street to the river is being renamed to &quot;The Shrine of the Silver Beaver&quot; in remembrance to one of Beaville&#039;s most tremendous residents During a heated murder trial, Silver &quot;Sam&quot; Beaver was found not guilty for the murder of Judith Heart Subsequent appeals, court decisions, and amici curiae briefs have made it virtually impossible to convict a beaver for murder Beaville, with a community beaver population close to 47%, has dedicated this year&#039;s Downtown Festival to Silver Sam Beaver, and many other esteemed beavers The Beaver statue is part of Beaville&#039;s continuing mission to improve and revitalize Downtown Park
