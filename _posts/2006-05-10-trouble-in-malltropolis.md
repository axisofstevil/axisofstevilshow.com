“A group of us got together and started The Mouth of the Walrus to give every one a chance to be themselves and afford clothing that not only looks good but presents a message: You don’t have to be clubbed to be cool” – Jesse Powenski, East Shore, NE teen and creator of The League of the Extraordinary, which operates The Mouth of the Walrus
