The list of improvements made to the park seemed sensible at first $17,000 was spent to improve existing trails and another $20,000 was committed to blazing two more park long nature trails Surprisingly, eighty percent of the entire improvement budget went to the installation of three &quot;outhouses&quot; scattered throughout the park The remainder of the budget was spent on “Greens fees” to construct a nineteen-hole golf course in a region of the park, which was destroyed two years ago by forest fires
