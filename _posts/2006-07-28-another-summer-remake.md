The lag time of western culture to reach mid western Asia is glacial  The summer of 2004 brought the halcyon days of 1989 to Iran and the liberating music of David Hasselhoff At present day, the region is now stuck in the turbulent early 1990’s The radio station of Tehran would be blasting “Jump Around“, and Eric Clapton&#039;s “Tears in Heaven” had the government not outlawed all western music In fact, the government of Iran has been spending a lot of time sifting through its entertainment imports, banning hip tunes On all levels of media, content is being censored, over dubbed, and re-cut to show a singular message as approved by the mullahs
