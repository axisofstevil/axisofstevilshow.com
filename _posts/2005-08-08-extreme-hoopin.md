In the late summer of 1999, The Axis of Stevil in conjuncture with Nukkalodean hosted the 2nd annual &quot;Blood and GutzFests; An all day alt Rock Extreme sport fest with the main event being a twenty country battle for the title &quot;Champion of the Agro-Slab&#039; Woodsy the Owl went undefeated for 23 rounds playing for 20 hours straight, a feat that has never been seen before or since This raw display of talent and determination captivated audiences around the world catapulting Woodsy and the Extreme Hoop to national notoriety Sadly Woodsyâ€™s fame was short lived, and quickly overshadowed by Tony Hawk doing a 900 on a skateboard Skateboarding became the intrinsic identifier of extreme sports and Extreme Hoop was left to a loyal but smaller niche audience
