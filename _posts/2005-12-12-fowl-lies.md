The sight of a dog wearing headphones, or a sea turtle selling fast food is not unheard of thanks to the constant barrage of  TV Over the past fifty years, television viewers have been desensitized to seeing animals acting as humans This fact was made painfully apparent when it was reveled before a live television audience that President George W Boosh was, in fact, a chicken; a giant chicken
It was then, with sweat dripping from his pores, the president’s brow fell off; falling wistfully down to the chief executive’s podium White House aids and television crew stared silently as the man who had led the country for the past five years was revealed to be the famous Chicken Boo Now unmasked, the tricky chicken ran clucking towards the hills, following in his father, , the famed Poultry Warrior&#039;s foot steps Chicken Boo left a trail of presidential garments and microphone equipment in his wake Filling the void of leadership Vice President  was sworn into office sixty-five minutes later aboard air force one
&quot;Punch that chicken in the face, Make him pay for my disgrace
Looking at recorded evidence, it is amazing that Boo was not found out earlier From his bizarre eating styles, the mismanagement of foreign affairs, French Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin&#039;s constant remarks that Boosh being a giant chicken, and the undeniable fact that hindsight is 20/20, it is clear now that we were blind to the obvious The evidence was there; how could we not have seen it for so long Let this be a lesson for the country in 2008 Stay informed and vote a human into office
