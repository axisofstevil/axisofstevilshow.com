Using a brilliant smile and broadly appealing stock art, Valentine tricks the unsuspecting web enthusiasts into buying &quot;cheap, effective web hosting” After getting your credit card information, he will provide you only the minimalist of services Going along with his service par, Skeeter has several policies and practices designed to keep customers from bothering him One such practice is the use of a custom designed phone system that keeps all incoming calls on hold, forcing the client to wait for a mysteriously busy customer service representative Mixed with the claims of owning a series of trailers and camp grounds in The Smokies, a PO Box in New York, NY, a datacenter in Cedar Falls, Missouri, and a research station in Western Siberia, Russia, this company seems to be so large that their misguided costumer service is excusable Ironically named “The Best Web Hosting&quot;, this mob front builds up a convincing façade that is successful at fooling even the most experienced of the web-savvy Should a customer become so enraged that they file grievances against the web hosting company, by terms of service contracts, all legal matters shall be settled in Onslow County, Florida; currently the most lenient court in the lower 48 states
