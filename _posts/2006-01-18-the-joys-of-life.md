A common misconception of the universe is that Fraggles and Doozers live in a harmonious balance under the surface of the earth This is not the case In fact it is another example of reality distorted by television Using refined radishes, the Doozers spend their days constructing large pieces of scaffolding that taste and smell of a sweet candy to Fraggle nostrils Have you ever wondered why they build so much, just to have it destroyed It is not their desire to construct, but to live It is a sad fact that when there are no Doozer buildings to be eaten, Fragglies will turn their appetites on Doozers themselves
Barbaric Not hardly Life and Death are part of the natural order What IS barbaric is the exploitation of Fraggle appetites by baked good mogul, Bill Rosenberg He lured the Doozers away from Fraggle Rock and into a large fenced track of land on North Cape Cod by promising a large colony a life of safety and security, where they could build all that they wanted without worry It is here, Doozers are born, nurtured, slaughtered, and finally baked into warm glazed treats To be sold to Fraggles, Gorgs, and any other animal with a sweet tooth at Dunkinâ€™ Doozers
