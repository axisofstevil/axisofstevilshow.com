Once every century, the board game designers and legion of villains known as Darker Brothers kick off a one-day pre-sale in authorized retailers across the country The Viacom subsidiary is celebrating the worldâ€™s most evil day by slashing prices on all its infamous products While not normally known for their generosities, the organizations of evil industrialists have planned two days of sales to draw consumers out of their homes and into stores The heavy symbolism of the sixth day of the sixth month of the sixth year serves as a lighting rod of misfortune Shoppers are 58% more likely to fall down the escalators, bounce a check, or be decapitated by a jack-knifing semi on the way to the store By luring consumers to malls and shopping centers (and increasing their risk of disaster) Darker Brothers hopes to make this 6/6/6 the most tragic yet
